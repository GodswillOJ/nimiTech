          Cyber attacks are becoming more frequent and sophisticated, putting businesses of all
          sizes at risk. From data breaches and ransomware to compliance violations, the
          consequences can be devastatingâ€”financial losses, legal penalties, and damage to your
          brandâ€™s trust. Nimitech IT helps you stay one step ahead with proactive, enterprise-grade
          protection designed to keep your business safe 24/7.
